Show ONE pair of the exact white platform lace-up sneakers, synthetic upper, thick platform sole, minimal urban style, no logos. Hero product large and sharp, 3/4 angle, slightly elevated to emphasize the discreet platform height. Background: clean light-to-mid gray gradient with subtle shadow under the shoes for stability. Add a minimal vertical measuring guide silhouette behind the shoe (abstract, not a person) to suggest visual height, with soft blur so the shoe remains the sharpest element. Lighting: crisp softbox, high contrast edges, clean whites without clipping. Leave clear space top-left for headline and top-right for badges. No people, no faces, no extra products.",
